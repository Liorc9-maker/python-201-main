Do an online search for interesting Python packages on PyPI.
You can search for something you're interested to do with your programming
skills and add "Python package" to the search query.
- What do you find?

I've found many interesting packages but thoght
since I already have Django installed maybe I'll try to go through the getting started tuturial.
I will definitley finish it sometime but meanwhile... I found pyjokes and rich.

- Create a new virtual environment and install the package.
- Check out its documentation and their "Getting Started" guide
  and code examples, if there are any.
- Can you get some basic functionality of the package to work locally?

I made a joke bot there is a copy in the projects folder.
